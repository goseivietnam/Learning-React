          If you want to trigger a refresh of the Vite configuration file, you need to restart the Vite development
          server. Here are the steps to refresh the Vite configuration: Stop the running Vite development server. You
          can do this by terminating the process in your terminal where you started the server. Press Ctrl+C (or Cmd+C
          on macOS) to stop the server. Make the necessary changes to the Vite configuration file. Start the Vite
          development server again. Run the Vite development server command in your terminal to start the server with
          the updated configuration. For example, if you were using npm run dev, you would run the same command again to
          start the server:
        </p>
      </Layout1>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
